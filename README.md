# Guitar-Scales

A program that displays different scales on a guitar fretboard

By: Antonio Rivera


This Python-based application is used to help guitar players visualize scales. Users are able to select a key and a quality, and from there can easily and fluently switch between different scales in that key.

[Click Here to Download](https://github.com/antonioddrivera/Guitar-Scales/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the zip folder that includes the readme, the license, and only the necessary files.

Run GuitarScale.exe to start. Note that it has to be in the root folder to access the custom font and image.
Next, select a key and a quality. You will then be able to select a scale. Once a scale is selected, a fretboard will appear with the notes of the scale.
If you want to change scales, click the selected scale, and then choose another. The fretboard will automatically change.

Hitting the return button will allow you to change the quality/key if desired.

The extra branch includes the original illustrator file if you want to make your fretboard.
