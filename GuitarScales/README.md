# Guitar-Scales
A program that displays different scales on a guitar fretboard

By: Antonio Rivera


This Python-based application is used to help guitar players visualize scales. Users can select a key and a quality, and from there can easily and fluently switch between different scales in that key.

Start by selecting the quality and the key. Then select the scale you want to see. If you want to switch scales, click on the scale you selected and the menu will appear again. Once a new scale is selected, the fretboard will automatically change.

Hit the return button to change the key and/or quality.
